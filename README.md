# Smart City Waste Monitoring & Risk Analysis

Built a Smart City Waste Monitoring dashboard using SQL, Python, Machine Learning, and Power BI. Analyzed waste collection trends, overflow risks, and high-risk zones using KMeans clustering and predictive models. This project shows how data analytics can support better city cleanliness and planning. Open to Data Analyst roles.

This project analyzes waste collection data to identify overflow risks and high-risk zones in urban areas using SQL, Python, Machine Learning, and Power BI.

## Tools Used
- MySQL for data storage
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn)
- Power BI for visualization

## Steps Performed
1. Created database and generated data using MySQL
2. Cleaned missing values and performed EDA in Python
3. Built ML models to predict overflow
4. Applied KMeans clustering for risk classification
5. Designed interactive Power BI dashboard

## Key Insights
- Certain areas show consistently higher fill levels
- Overflow is strongly related to complaints and low collection frequency
- Clustering identifies high-risk waste zones
